Install this for smbus:

sudo apt-get install python-smbus

Install this next:


git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_PureIO.git<BR>
cd Adafruit_Python_PureIO<BR>
sudo python setup.py install<BR>

Other installations required for AM2315:

sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev


#Installing apscheduler

sudo pip install --upgrade setuptools pip <BR>

sudo pip install setuptools --upgrade  <BR>
sudo pip install apscheduler <BR>


----------------<BR>
Note some configurations of Raspberry Pi software requres the following:<BR>
It won't hurt to do this in any case.<BR>
----------------<BR>
<pre>
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential python-pip python-dev python-smbus git
git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_GPIO.git
cd Adafruit_Python_GPIO
sudo python setup.py install
cd ..
cd SDL_Pi_GroveWeatherPi
cd Adafruit_Python_SSD1306
sudo python setup.py install

-----------
setup your configuration variables in config.py!

--------
Add SQL instructions
----------

Use phpmyadmin or sql command lines to add the included SQL file to your MySQL databases.<BR>
Note:  If the database has been updated, run the example below to update your database.   The current contents will not be lost.


example:   sudo mysql -u root -p GroveWeatherPi< GroveWeatherPi.sql

user:  root

password: password

Obviously with these credentials, don't connect port 3306 to the Internet.   Change them if you aren't sure.

NOTE:

If you have a WXLink wireless transmitter installed, the software assumes you have connected your AM2315 outdoor temp/humidity sensor to the WXLink.  If you put another AM2315 on your local system, it will use those values instead of the WXLink values
